Welcome to a implementation of Software Product Line for Professor Arturo final project

We implemented an SPL for a space invader's kind of game using pygame library. Our goal is to apply the theory of 
Object Oriented SPL in games. Using pygame we created interfaces to be instantiated by the developer which will 
focus on a 2D game shooter.

The interfaces will be found inside the LPS folder for reference to create the components.

We also have two implementations in both Alien_descend and _____________ folders in which our components were created
on the Components.py file.

All of our used sprites, images and sounds are stored inside the Game folder, along with some images for the developer
to use.

Thank you,

Ricardo Fragoso(@Karagusto)
